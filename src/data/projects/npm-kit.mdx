## About  
AutoSuggestion Kit is a powerful and lightweight React autosuggestion/autocomplete component designed to deliver fast and intuitive search experiences. It supports both static and asynchronous data sources, advanced keyboard navigation, and built-in search history using localStorage—all with zero external dependencies.

## Installation
```bash
npm install autosuggestion-kit
```

## Key Features

- **Static and async suggestions** — use local arrays or fetch suggestions dynamically  
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys to navigate, enter to select, escape to close  
- **Search history** — automatically remembers recent selections using localStorage  
- **Debouncing** — delays input processing to reduce unnecessary fetches  
- **Caching** — caches previous async queries for faster repeated results  
- **Customizable styling and rendering** — easily adapt styles to fit your project
